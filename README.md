# ReMinicraft+
![Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37089149/153483527-16dbda7d-5a11-4b93-b267-14564a7bfc58.png)
A Minicraft+ Texture Pack with the intention of keeping Minicraft's style but slightly enhancing it and increasing it's consistency, with a couple inspirations and ideas taken from the Ulracraft texture pack was well.

The biggest changes are with the entities, with Items being next, and the Tiles and GUI being change in the least visible way. However, they all have little changes to them to make them, in my opinion, a little bit better.
In this texture pack I made a specific change to the Knights, specifically by giving higher leveled Knights having bigger shields. This change may or may not be to your taste, so I'll include a version of this texture pack with all of the sheilds the same shape and size if you prefer how the shields are in the base game. To change the texture pack to use the uniform sheild design, go into the ReMinicraft+ archive and rename `entities.png` to whatever you'd like, then rename `entities-baseshields.png` to `entities.png`.

To install this texture pack, first download this repository as a ZIP. Next, go to `%appdata%\playminicraft\mods\Minicraft_Plus\TexturePacks` and place the ReMinicraft+ archive file in there. Then, to activate it within the game, in the Main Menu (*not* in-game) go to `Options>Texture Packs>ReMinicraft+.zip`.

I've also created a skin for you to use that matches the rest of the entities in ReMinicraft+ that I've 'cleverly' named "Paulveralls," as well as a version with a cape. To install this skin in [2.1.0](https://github.com/MinicraftPlus/minicraft-plus-revived/releases/tag/v2.1.0-dev1), go to `%appdata%\playminicraft\mods\Minicraft_Plus\skins` and place the Paulveralls.png (or Caped Paulveralls.png) file from the ReMinicraft+ archive in there. To activate it within game, in the Main Menu go to `Skins>Paulveralls`. I don't mind if you use or edit this skin for personal use.
